Apache-AxKit-Provider-XMLDOMProvider version 0.01
=================================================

Apache::AxKit::Provider::XMLDOMProvider allows for local transformation of
remote XML-Files available via HTTP. The remote XML-file for local processing
can be specified in the Apache::AxKit configuration. Additionally, an element
holding adequate modification time information can be provided via the
Apache::AxKit configuration. This Apache::AxKit-Provider is very useful for
local processing of dynamically generated XML-DOMs available via a Web-server,
especially if one needs to pass specific query parameters to it. 

The URI of the remote XML-file is specified with the RemoteXML variable.
RemoteXMLmTimeElement should hold the name of the XML-Element which contains
date information when the remote XML-file was last modified (format "YYYY-MM-DD
hh:mm"; e.g. "2007-07-15 16:20"). Is the element specifying the modification
time not present, the remote XML-file will not be cached and hence fetched for
each request. This module uses LWP::UserAgent to get remote XML-files.
